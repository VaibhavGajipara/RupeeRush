#  RupeeRush – Stock Trading Simulator (C++)

RupeeRush is a console-based stock trading simulation system developed using **C++** as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** coursework. The project simulates a simplified Indian stock market environment where users can trade stocks, manage portfolios, and analyze investment risk.

---

##  Project Objective

The objective of RupeeRush is to apply **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** to build a real-world inspired application that demonstrates:
- Modular class-based design
- Data persistence using file handling
- Dynamic stock price simulation
- Portfolio and risk analysis

---

##  Features

-  Simulated Indian stock market with dynamic price fluctuations  
-  Buy and sell stocks with balance validation  
-  Portfolio management and holdings tracking  
-  Profit/Loss calculation and total worth analysis  
-  Risk assessment based on capital concentration  
-  Persistent portfolio storage using file handling  
-  Menu-driven, user-friendly console interface  

---

##  Technologies & Concepts Used

- **Language:** C++  
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **STL Containers:** `vector`, `unordered_map`  
- **File Handling:** `fstream`  
- **Other Concepts:** Randomization, Time-based simulation  

---

##  System Design Overview

- **Stock Class**  
  Handles stock details, pricing, and price fluctuation logic  

- **User Class**  
  Manages user balance, portfolio, buying/selling of stocks, and file storage  

- **TradingSystem Class**  
  Maintains market stocks and simulates stock market behavior  

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**

- Hands-on experience with **STL data structures**

- Understanding of file handling and data persistence

- Simulation of real-world financial systems

- Improved code organization and modularity

---

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple user support

- Transaction history and logs

- Sorting and searching of stocks

- Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- Real-time stock data integration using APIs
